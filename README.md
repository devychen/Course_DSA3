# Course Data Structuresand Algorithms 3
The [Course Web Page](https://dsacl3-2024.github.io/) <br>
Last year [course page](https://dsacl3-2024.github.io/) <br>

### For me
1. Follow lectures, read the book if necessary, but mainly on the slides.
2. **Practice matters**, do the labs from this year and last year.
3. Maybe join the exam, no group project
